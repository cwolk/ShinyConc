# ShinyConc

# About
ShinyConc is a framework for __generating custom web-based concordancers__.
To see it in action, __[try the Inaugural Corpus demo](http://shinyconc.de/inaugural/)__.

The ShinyConc project was created by Christoph Wolk and Bridgit Fastrich for the University of Giessen.

## Slice and dice your data
Do you have _rich annotations_ for your texts? ShinyConc allows you to __easily select the components of your corpus__ to use for your analysis. You can even restrict searches to texts containing particular words.

## Powerful corpus-linguistic tools
In addition to the __KWIC__ view, ShinyConc offers powerful __regex-based counting__, __word lists__, and __keyword analyses between subcorpora__. All of this works together with the __flexible filtering__ mechanisms.

## Easy setup
__Get started in minutes__ - all you need is an internet connection, R, RStudio, and a .csv file containing the metadata for your corpus. We have a __[http://shinyconc.de/tutorial.pdf](detailed tutorial)__ that walks you through the process.

## Extensible with shiny
If you need more than what basic ShinyConc can do, you have the full power of R and Shiny at your fingertips. ShinyConc is free, open source software.

## Cross-platform, local and web
ShinyConc runs on any computer running R and RStudio/Shiny, including Windows, Mac, and Linux. If you choose to host your concordancer on the web, it can also be accessed using mobile devices (Android/iOS phones and tablets).
